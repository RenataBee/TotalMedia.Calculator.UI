## Objectives
To create two projects. The first with the FrontEnd using Angular (the most recently version) and the second using .Net Core 6.0

## Projects
TotalMedia.Calculator.UI - This project use the most recently version of Angular. The angular 15 with the Material CSS framework/UI components

#### Users Stories

in Portugal, United Kingdom, Spain and France so that I can use correctly calculated 
data.

## Functionalities

## Technical Requirements
The frontend development framework or library can be chosen based on 
the candidate's preferences, however using the most recent version of 
Angular will be advantageous.
• the backend solution needs to be implemented in .NET6 (dotnet core)
• the list of countries and its respective rates should be retrieve from the 
backend
• nice to have: usage of Angular Material CSS framework/UI components 
(https://material.angular.io) or PrimeNG 
(https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/)
• the solution needs to be published in a public GitHub repository what 
could be accessed by Totalmedia team. Create a README file for 
compilation and run instructions if appropriate.
• bonus: the solution is covered with unit test
